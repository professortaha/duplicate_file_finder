# Duplicate File Finder

## Description
Duplicate File Finder is a Python application that helps users identify and manage duplicate files in a specified directory. Using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, the application provides a user-friendly way to find duplicate files based on their MD5 hash values, offering options to delete selected duplicates, keep only the first instance of each duplicate, or start a new search.

## Features
- **Find Duplicates**: Scans the selected directory for duplicate files.
- **Manage Duplicates**: Allows users to open, select, and delete duplicate files.
- **Group View**: Groups duplicate files for easier management.
